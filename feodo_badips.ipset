# [Abuse.ch Feodo tracker BadIPs] 
# (https://feodotracker.abuse.ch) The Feodo Tracker Feodo 
# BadIP Blocklist only contains IP addresses (IPv4) used as 
# C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan version B. 
# These IP addresses are usually servers rented by 
# cybercriminals directly and used for the exclusive purpose 
# of hosting a Feodo C&C server. Hence you should expect no 
# legit traffic to those IP addresses. The site highly 
# recommends you to block/drop any traffic towards any Feodo 
# C&C using the Feodo BadIP Blocklist. Please consider that 
# this blocklist only contains IP addresses used by version B 
# of the Feodo Trojan. C&C communication channels used by 
# version A, version C and version D are not covered by this 
# blocklist.
